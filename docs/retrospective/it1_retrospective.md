# Retrospective for iteration 1

## What we have done:
### front end:
Built a rough framework, set relative configurations, like axios, routers, etc.

Finished the Log-in page, which can verify email and password format, and set validation code.

Set up the basic view of the commodityList page for showing all of the commodities.

Set up the rough sketch of the commodity item page to show details of each listed item.

### back end:
Designed the user, commodityType and commodity models in the MVC framework.

Designed the user table and commodity table in the mysql database.

## What we have not done:
Connecting the backend with the front-end to show real-time data.

CRUD operations

## Challenges we have met:

### front end:
For the Log-in part, the challenging task is to create and verify validation code. Like, generating code using canvas.
Uniformed layout design was hard to achieve at the beginning(navigation, router etc.), since everyoneâ€™s initial work depends on it.

### back end:
Need to use myJH login interface to verify the students and faculties.

## What we want to do in the next iteration:

### front end:
For the next iteration(iteration 2), finish the commodityListPage and commodity single page.

For the next iteration(iteration 2), roughly finish the UserPage(including cart, userinfo, order detail, etc) if possible.

### back end:
For the next iteration(iteration 2), finish the user login through myJH.

For the next iteration(iteration 2), finish the connection between backend and frontend.

For the next iteration(iteration 2), complete the CRUD operation of the database.
